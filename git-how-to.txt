//*******************
How to set up set up global settings:

git config --global user.name bjcervantes
git config --global user.mail bjcervantes@navy.mil

// *****************
Create a repository repository:
git init

// To stage a modification:
git add <filename>
git add . (for all changed files in current folder)

// To commit changes
git commit -m "modification message"

// To see changes/commits
git log
git log --oneline

// Getting back in time. Getting to previous checkouts:
// Safest method
git chckeout "<log-number from git log command>"
git checkout master (to get to latest changes)

// undoing changes:
// Safer method. This change doesn't erase that specific log but\
// puts the commit at the front of the logs (will be the latest log)
get revert "<log-number from git log command>"

// Undoing changes:
// Can't undo changes.
get reset "<log-number from git log command>"        (changes remain in the editor in case you want to change your mind)
get reset "<log-number from git log command>" --hard ( Commits after that log will be lost forever)

// Branching
git branch -a (list all branches)
git branch <name of new branch> (create branch)
git checkout -b <name of the new branch> (creates and swithes to new branch)
git branch -D <name of new branch> (for branches that are not merged)
git branch -d <name of new branch> (for branches were merged)

// Merging
git checkout <branch that you want to merge in>
git merge <mergin branch>

// working with github
// Fist scenario: you have already a local repository
git push https://github.com/bjcervantes/git-one.git master (save local repository on the remote master branch)
or:
git remote add origin https://github.com/bjcervantes/git-one.git (alias for remote url)
git push origin master

// Second scenario: clone remote repository
cd to target folder.
git clone https://github.com/bjcervantes/crap-portfolio.git (this will download repos folder on targe folder)
git remote -v (see what aliases we have)

// Get latest code from remote
git pull origin master

// pushing a new branch changes to remote branch
git push origin <remote branch> (other than remote)
